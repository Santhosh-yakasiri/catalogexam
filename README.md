In the following project we are implementing polyonmial based lagrangian function on the native function of predictor variable they are ----
--- Let’s say S is the secret that we wish to encode.
--- It is divided into N parts: S1, S2, S3, …., Sn.
--- After dividing it, a number K is chosen by the user in order to decrypt the parts and find the original secret.
--- It is chosen in such a way that if we know less than K parts, then we will not be able to find the secret S (i.e.) the secret S can not be reconstructed with (K – 1) parts or fewer.
--- If we know K or more parts from S1, S2, S3, …., Sn, then we can compute/reconstructed our secret code S easily. This is conventionally called (K, N) threshold scheme.

From the following schema of Lagrangian coordinates we emphasize to calculate constant "C" from the polynomial based logits function over f(x) = log(k) where k is the predictor variable over x
